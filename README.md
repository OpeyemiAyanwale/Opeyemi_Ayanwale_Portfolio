Hi, I’m Opeyemi Ayanwale — a data analyst/data scientist with strong analytical and quantitative skills, passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. I enjoy working on projects that drive operational improvements and support strategic decision-making through the use of data.

I specialize in SQL, Python, R, data visualization, A/B testing, and business intelligence tools. My work encompasses user behavior analysis, product experimentation, and automated reporting.

Feel free to explore some of the projects I’ve worked on below — each showcases my approach to solving real-world problems with data.

# [Project 17: Enhancing Accommodation Data Quality and User Engagement at Trivago](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Trivago_Project_Overview)

A collection of data-driven projects focused on improving accommodation content quality, user experience, and platform analytics at Trivago. This project demonstrates the application of advanced data analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and experimental design and data quality techniques to solve real-world product and content challenges.


# [Project 16: Natural Language Processing Project Tasks Overview](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Natural-Language-Process-Tasks)

This project contains structured solutions and analyses for a set of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks designed to cover key text mining and modeling concepts using Python or R.

# [Project 15: Exploring the Effects of Socioecobomic Factors on Well-beings](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Effects-of-Socioeconomic-Factors-on-Well-being)

Examining the key determinants contributing to life satisfaction in Germany and comparing these findings with international contexts, specifically the United States and China, using the World Values Survey Wave 7 (2012- 2022) and time-series data of the WVS.

# [Project 14: Eye Tracking Analysis](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Eye-Tracking-Analysis)

Investigating age-related trends in fixation durations and identifying systematic patterns in fixation behaviour throughout an experiment using the Dutch Science Museum Nemo eye-tracking dataset.

# [Project 13: Sentiment Analysis Review](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Sentiment-Analysis-Review)

Sentiment analysis, prediction modeling, and negative review clustering were used to analyze 20k hotel reviews extracted from Tripadvisor via Kaggle. The findings can help the hotel industry improve customer satisfaction and decision-making processes.


# [Project 12: Inventory Management System](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Inventory-Management-System)

An inventory management system that automates end-to-end production, business management, demand forecasting, and accounting to streamline the ordering, storage, and use of inventory.

# [Project 11: Regression Analysis](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Regression_Analysis)

Examined the relationship between the dependent (response) and independent (explanatory) variables. Select a suitable subset of independent variables for the best subset model. Evaluate the model, create a residual plot and examine it for patterns of linearity, heteroskedasticity, and normality.

# [Project 10: Comparision of Multiple Distribution](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Comparison_Multiple_Distribution)

Descriptive statistics to briefly describe the distribution of the variables. Conducted a global test and pairwise differences between all pairs of categories. Conducted two-sample tests and adjusted the test results with the Bonferroni correction and Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD). Compared the results of these two correction methods with the results of the non-adjusted test.


# [Project 9: Data preprocessing and plots, Regression and Webscraping](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Combined-Project)

This is a combined project that consists of data preprocessing and plots, regression analysis to estimate all possible models, and webscraping that scrapes the Wikipedia articles for all US presidents and extracts specific information from each page. Start by accessing the URL 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States'. Then, use this page to generate a CSV file named 'US_presidents.csv'.

# [Project 8: Text Mining](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Text_Mining)

This is a short project on text mining (spacy, sklearn, gensim): preprocessing, tokenization, sentiment analysis and topic modeling.


# [Project 7: Regression and Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Regressions_and_ML) 

Machine learning algorithm (statsmodels, sklearn) with the top 500 football player dataset.  Data visualization using Matplotlib is used to visualize the most valuable player, the market value distribution of players, the age distribution of players, etc.


# [Project 6: Data Preprocessing with Python](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Data-Preprocessing-Python)

Data preprocessing of the top 500 football player dataset. Efficient vector processing, working with pandas data frames, pandas series objects, indexing, and filtering.


# [Project 5: Multivariate Data Analysis in R](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Multivariate-Analysis-in-R)

Cluster analysis was conducted with the Chatterjee-Price attitude dataset, which can be found in the datasets package in R. The data is aggregated from a survey of clerical employees, which contains 35 employees from 30 randomly selected departments. The non-hierarchical (k-means)method is used to determine the distinct groups in the Chatterjee-price attitude data.


# [Project 4: Data Analytics Essentials with Power BI](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Data-Analytics-Essentials-with-Power-BI)

The project uses the Superstore dataset for this analysis. Data preparation, modeling, and visualization were carried out using Microsoft Power BI combined with Excel.


# [Project 3: Grocery Chain Project with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/SQL-Query)

The project requires building an Enterprise Data warehousing that addresses the analytics requirements for the business. The following databases, Grocery, Grocery Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), Grocery Staging, and Grocery Warehouse, were created.


# [Project 2: Microsoft SQL Database Schema Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Microsoft-SQL-Database-Schema)

This project created the schema and database employees_db, which has four tables: Employees, Locations, and Departments. SQL queries and subqueries were used to solve the following question in the SQL project file.


# [Project 1: Descriptive Analysis of Demographic Data Using R](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Descriptive-Analysis-of-Demographic-Data)

This project uses the dataset of the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which contains various demographic data (currently from 1950 to 2060) on all states and regions of the world recognized by the US Department of State. The dataset analyzed in this report is a small extract from the IDB for the year 2001-2021.
