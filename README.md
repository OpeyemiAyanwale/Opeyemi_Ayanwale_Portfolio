My name is Opeyemi Ayanwale, and I am a data analyst with strong analytical and quantitative abilities. I am passionate about leading projects that leverage data insights to improve business operations and strategic initiatives. Seeking to apply my data analytics skills to provide digital solutions that meet business objectives and client needs. And here are a few of the projects I worked on for your review in my portfolio.



# [Project 1: Descriptive Analysis of Demographic Data Using R](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Descriptive-Analysis-of-Demographic-Data)

This project uses the dataset of the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which contains various demographic data (currently from 1950 to 2060) on all states and regions of the world recognized by the US Department of State. The dataset analyzed in this report is a small extract from the IDB for the year 2001-2021.


# [Project 2: Microsoft SQL Database Schema Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Microsoft-SQL-Database-Schema)

This project created the schema and database employees_db which has four tables: Employees, Locations, and Departments. SQL queries and subqueries was used to solve the following question in the SQL project file.


# [Project 3: Grocery Chain Project with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/SQL-Query)

The project requires building an Enterprise Data warehousing that addresses the analytics requirements for the business. The following databases Grocery, Grocecey Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), Grocery Staging, and Grocery Warehouse were created.


# [Project 4: Data Analytics Essentials with Power BI](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Data-Analytics-Essentials-with-Power-BI)

The project uses the superstore dataset for this analysis. Data preparation, modeling, and visualization were carried out using Microsoft Power BI combined with Excel.


# [Project 5: Multivariate Data Analysis in R](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Multivariate-Analysis-in-R)

Cluster analysis was conducted with the Chatterjee-price attitude dataset which can be found in the datasets package in R. The data is aggregated from a survey of clerical employees which contains 35 employees from 30 randomly selected departments. Non-hierarchical (k-means)method is used to determine the distinct group in the Chatterjee-price attitude data.


# [Project 6: Data Preprocessing with Python](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Data-Preprocessing-Python)

Data preprocessing of the top 500 football player dataset. Efficient vector processing, working with pandas data frames, pandas series objects, indexing, and filtering.


# [Project 7: Regression and Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Regressions_and_ML) 

Machine learning algorithm (statsmodels, sklearn) with the top 500 football player dataset.  Data visualization using Matplotlib is used to visualize the most valuable player, the market value distribution of players, the age distribution of players, etc.


# [Project 8: Text Mining](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Text_Mining)

This is a short project on text mining (spacy, sklearn, gensim): preprocessing, tokenization, sentiment analysis and topic modeling.


# [Project 9: Combined Project (Data preprocessing and plots, Regression, and Webscraping)](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Combined-Project)

This is a combined project that consists of data preprocessing and plots, regression analysis to estimate all possible models, and webscraping that scrapes the Wikipedia articles for all US presidents and extracts specific information from each page. Start by accessing the URL 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States'. Then, use this page to generate a CSV file named 'US_presidents.csv'.


# [Project 10: Comparision of Multiple Distribution](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Comparison_Multiple_Distribution)

Descriptive statistics to briefly describe the distribution of the variables. Conducted a global test and pairwise differences between all pairs of categories. Conducted two-sample tests and adjusted the test results with the Bonferroni correction and Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD). Compared the results of these two correction methods with the results of the non-adjusted test.


# [Project 11: Regression Analysis](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Regression_Analysis)

Examined the relationship between the dependent (response) and independent (explanatory) variables. Select a suitable subset of independent variables for the best subset model. Evaluate the model, create a residual plot and examine it for patterns of linearity, heteroskedasticity, and normality


# [Project 12: Inventory Management System](https://github.com/OpeyemiAyanwale/Inventory-Management-System)

An inventory management system that automates end-to-end production, business management, demand forecasting, and accounting to streamline the ordering, storage, and use of inventory.
